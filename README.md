# PuhistOS

### What the heck is this?

Dear strangers on internet, I don't know. A russian hussle project apparently from a kid.

And I lost connection with the kid a looong way ago.

This is an old version of his stuff? Treat this as an archive.

There's branches for different versions. Also, "PuhistOS" is my suggestion for his OS, sooo, you can find out more.
